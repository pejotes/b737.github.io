## Welcome to b737 project

In a next few years I would like to build real as possible (on my budget) replica of Boeing 737 cockpit. I want to use some plug and play components, but include also my own made parts and devices.


## Software

### Flight Simulators
- Prepar 3D v5.2
- MSFS 2020

### ProSim 737 - Professional Boeing 737 Simulation Suite

**Current Version:** ProSim737 v3.28 (Released February 1, 2024)

ProSim737 is a professional-grade avionics and systems simulation suite designed for Boeing 737 cockpit builders. Version 3.x represents a major evolution with completely rewritten FMS, LNAV/VNAV systems, and enhanced realism.

#### Key Features of Version 3.28

**Flight Management System (FMS)**
- Completely new FMS implementation with advanced LNAV/VNAV engine
- Improved route tracking and navigation performance monitoring
- Actual Navigation Performance (ANP) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) displays
- Common VNAV mode with enhanced descent page functionality

**Systems Simulation**
- Over 200 modeled malfunctions for realistic training scenarios
- Detailed aircraft systems modeling
- Sophisticated and realistic flight model characteristics
- Dual-channel yaw damper with WTRIS (Wind-up Turn Runway Incursion System) capability
- Complete power transient protection systems

**Audio Enhancements (v3.28)**
- New cockpit environment sounds including:
  - Oxygen mask deployment sounds
  - V-speed callouts
  - Pack sounds
  - Stick shaker audio
- Advanced audio group management facility
- Voice ATIS functionality
- SATCOM IO elements

**Display Improvements (v3.28)**
- Fixed altitude prediction arc rendering
- Enhanced TCAS rings in CTR mode
- PARKED VREF cockpit setup option for parked reference speeds with flap/speed values

**Hardware Compatibility**
- Integrated MCP display (no longer requires separate module)
- Support for CPFlight V2 hardware and new ACP/SIDE panels
- Phidgets driver with VINT card support (library v1.17.20231004)
- Broad compatibility with major hardware providers (Flightdeck Solutions, CPFlight, OpenCockpits)
- Compatible with Prepar3D v5 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

**Recent Enhancements (v3.28)**
- Improved version manager for troubleshooting and file backup
- Enhanced Navigraph frequency handling for non-833 spacing support
- FS2020 altitude handling improvements
- Fixed approach mode armed logic issues

#### Supported Aircraft Variants
- Boeing 737-700
- Boeing 737-800 (B738)
- Boeing 737-900
- Boeing 737 MAX (separate suite available)

## PC Hardware

3 x Intel PC

### Main PC
